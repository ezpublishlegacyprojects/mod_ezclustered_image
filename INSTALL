What is this extension made for ?
=================================

This module fetches image content objects from 
the eZ Publish cluster. This module is a replacement
of the index_image*.php file.

Prerequisities
==============

Prerequisities for the module are described below : 

1. Apache 2.2
2. mod_dbd loaded [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_dbd.html]
2. Apache compiled with MySQL support, ie with ``--with-mysql=/path/to/mysql``

Supported databases
===================

This module has been successfully testef with
MySQL but should work fine with PostgreSQL and Oracle

Compiling this extension ?
==========================

I hope this copy/paste tutorial will be usefull

::

    tar zxvf mod_ezclustered_image.tar.gz
    cd mod_ezclustered_image
    apxs -cia mod_ezclustered_image.c
    apache2ctl restart


This will compile, install and load the module

Configuring the module
======================

In your VirtualHost, you have to do the following :

1. remove the following RewriteRules : 

::

    Rewriterule ^/var/([^/]+/)?storage/images-versioned/.*  /index_cluster.php  [L]
    Rewriterule ^/var/([^/]+/)?storage/images/.*            /index_cluster.php  [L]

2. add the following configuration in your VirtualHost:

::

    DBDriver mysql
    DBDParams "host=localhost port=3306 user=root pass=publish dbname=dicod"
    DBDPrepareSQL "SELECT datatype, mtime, size, filedata, ezdbfile.name_hash FROM ezdbfile, ezdbfile_data WHERE ezdbfile.name_hash = ezdbfile_data.name_hash AND ezdbfile.name_hash = MD5( %s ) AND scope = 'image' ORDER BY offset;" ezdbfile_sql

    <LocationMatch "/var/([^/]+/)?storage/(images|images-versioned)+/.*">
        SetHandler ezclustered_image
    </LocationMatch>


You must be warned about three things :

1. Splitting the "DBDPrepareSQL" line will not work, you will get a configuration error

2. Changing the name of the prepared statement ``ezdbfile_sql`` will disable the extension

If you do not want to use the MySQL Driver you can configure another driver
(like Postgres for example). Please read the documentation on how to do this : 

- http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_dbd.html#dbdparams

Testing
=======

After everything is compiled and configured, restart Apache and call
any URL of your eZ Publish intallation. If you get images then everything
is OK
